## üí° Key Features & Technical Decisions

This mockup was developed to demonstrate knowledge in clean, semantic HTML structure and modern CSS techniques, adhering strictly to the assignment's "self-contained" requirement.

  * **Self-Contained Implementation:** All styling is managed within a single `<style>` block in the `index.html` file, avoiding external CSS files.
  * **Semantic HTML5:** Uses modern elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for clear structure and accessibility.
  * **Custom Typography:** Integrates required Google Fonts (`Cabin`, `Poppins`, `Source Sans Pro`) for branding and hierarchy.
  * **Responsive Design:** Implemented a media query (`@media (max-width: 768px)`) to ensure optimal viewing and stacking order on mobile devices.
  * **CSS Grid Layout:** Utilized CSS Grid for the **"Cellular Fuel"** section to manage the three-column layout efficiently.
  * **Brand Color Palette:** Strict adherence to the provided brand color scheme (Dark Blue, Medium Blue, etc.) for a cohesive look.
